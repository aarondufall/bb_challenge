students
- Has many goals
	A student can have more than on goals, but each students goals are unique.

- Has many assignments through homework
	A student can have homework assgined to them from a list of assignments based on there individual goals.

homework(Join Table)
- belongs to student
- belongs to assigments
	Assigments can be reused more than once for each student.

assignments
- Has many assginment_skills(Join Table)
	Reusable list of assignments.

assignment_skills(Join Table)
- belongs to skill
- belongs to assgiment
	An assignment can help you improve more than one skill

skills
- has many assigments through assignment_skills
- has many goals through achivments
	Reusable list of skills.

achivements(Join Table)
- belongs to skill
- belongs to goals
	One goal can work towards more than one skill, but skill can also apply to more than one students goals

goals
- belongs to student
- has_many skills through achivements
	A student can have many goals that improve many skills.

	An alternative choice would be have a goal belong to a skill and a skill can have many goals, but that would mean that a goal only works towards a single skill and if that where the case I think I would be easier to just assign skill directly to students.
